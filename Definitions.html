************* Creational Patterns *************
1.Abstract Factory
(Frequency of use: High)
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

2.Factory Method
(Frequency of use: High)
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. 

3.Singleton
(Frequency of use: Medium high)
Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it. 

4.Prototype
(Frequency of use: Medium)
Specify the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype. 

5.Builder
(Frequency of use: Medium low)
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. 



************* Structural Patterns *************
1.Facade
(Frequency of use: High)
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Fa√ßade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. 

2.Adapter
(Frequency of use: Medium high)
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. 

3.Composite
(Frequency of use: Medium high)
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 

4.Proxy
(Frequency of use: Medium high)
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. 

5.Bridge
(Frequency of use: Medium)
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. 

6.Decorator
(Frequency of use: Medium)
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. 

7.Flyweight
(Frequency of use: Medium low)
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. 



************* Behavioral Patterns *************
1.Iterator 
(Frequency of use: High)
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. 

2.Observer
(Frequency of use: High)
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. 

3.Command
(Frequency of use: Medium high)
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. 


4.Strategy
(Frequency of use: Medium high)
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. 

5.State
(Frequency of use: Medium)
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. 

6.Template Method
(Frequency of use: Medium)
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure. 
 
7.Chain of Responsibility
(Frequency of use: Medium low)
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it. 
 
8.Mediator
(Frequency of use: Medium low)
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently. 

9.Interpreter
(Frequency of use: Low)
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language. 

10.Memento
(Frequency of use: Low)
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later. 

11.Visitor
(Frequency of use: Low)
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
